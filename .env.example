# Vritti Auth - Micro-frontend Module
# =====================================
#
# ZERO ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES IN PRODUCTION
# -----------------------------------------
# This micro-frontend uses ZERO environment variables in production builds.
# All API calls use relative /api/* paths that work in any environment.
#
# Benefits:
# - Same build artifact works in ANY environment (dev, staging, prod)
# - No environment-specific rebuilds needed
# - Automatic domain adaptation
# - Simplified deployment
#
# How it works:
# - OAuth Redirects: Uses relative /api/cloud-api/auth/oauth/{provider}
# - Dev: Rsbuild proxy forwards /api/* to localhost:3000
# - Prod: Nginx proxy forwards /api/* to backend service
#
# ==============================================
# LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ONLY
# ==============================================
# The variables below are ONLY used during local development
# for dev server proxy configuration. They are NOT used in production builds.

# Dev Server Proxy Target
# Rsbuild dev server will proxy /api/* requests to this URL
REACT_API_HOST=http://localhost:3000

# Enable HTTPS for Local Development
# Set to "true" to use HTTPS with local certificates (mkcert)
# Useful for testing OAuth flows and secure contexts
USE_HTTPS=false

# ==============================================
# PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT
# ==============================================
# Production builds require NO environment variables.
# Just run: pnpm build
#
# The build output (dist/) includes:
# - mf-manifest.json: Module Federation manifest
# - static/: JavaScript, CSS, and image assets
#
# Deploy to: /opt/vritti/www/vritti-auth/ on the server
# The host application loads this via: {domain}/vritti-auth/mf-manifest.json
#
# GitHub Actions Variables (for deployment workflows only):
# - APP_DOMAIN: Production domain for health checks (e.g., cloud.vrittiai.com)
# - SERVER_VM_HOST: Server hostname/IP (secret)
# - SERVER_VM_USER: SSH username (secret)
# - SERVER_VM_SSH_KEY: SSH private key (secret)
